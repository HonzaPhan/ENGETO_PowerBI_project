<h1> ENGETO PowerBI project </h1>

<p>
In this project I focus on my visual skills, where I primarly gave attetion to world population and economic indicators. 
<br>
First of all I converted these datasets from <a href = "https://data.gov.cz/english/"> Open Data Portal of the Czech Republic </a> to CSV file:
<ul>
<li>countries - All kinds of information about countries in the world, for example the capital city, currency, national food or average height of the population </li>
<li><a href = "https://github.com/HonzaPhan/Engeto_SQL_project/blob/main/t_long_phan_project_SQL_secondary_final.sql">secondary table</a> from previous SQL project - only with a small change in a WHERE clause:
"WHERE 
   c.country IS NOT NULL AND 
   tlp.year_measurement IS NOT NULL" </li>
</ul>
I imported datasets to PowerBI and made necessary changes (changing data types, delete null values, formatting, joining tables etc.) in a PowerQuery.
<br>Then I created 2 pages (World population and GDP & GINI) and then added data fields, which I prepared. I needed a suitable background so I chose  Universe <a href = "https://www.ppt-backgrounds.net/space/3177-space-PPT-backgrounds.html">https://www.ppt-backgrounds.net/space/3177-space-PPT-backgrounds.html</a>. 
<br>Now when my preparation is ready, I simply made magic by adding and editing positions for each visualizations, slicers, buttons, bookmarks etc. 
<br>I tried to follow these assignments, which ENGETO gave us:
<ul>
<li>Range 2-3 pages</li>
<li>Using at least 5 different types of visuals</li>
<li>Filtering with slicers</li>
<li>Use of bookmarks/page navigation</li>
<li>Connecting multiple data sources, whether in Power Query or Power BI</li>
<li>Using a data hierarchy of at least two levels</li>
<li>Creation of at least 1 measure and 1 calculated column</li>
<li>Graphic editing of the used visuals and a visually friendly resulting report</li>
</ul>
